## Modules
are RW style modules, classes containing functions and data combined, able to be inherited.
A dictionary is used to check for the existance of modules in a character.

These are significantly less performance friendly than components, 
but only slightly worse in performance from hard-coding it into classes, in exchange for the compartmentalization and modularity of the functionality.

## Components
If you know of ECS or Data Oriented Design Principles, this is that.

Mainly used for cosmetics.
